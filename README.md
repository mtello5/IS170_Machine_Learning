# K-Nearest Neighbors
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a supervised machine learning technique that can be applied to classification and regression problems.It is also known as KNN or k-NN. Although it can be applied to issues involving either regression or classification, it is more commonly employed as a classification technique because it is based on the concept that points with similar characteristics can be discovered in close proximity to one another. KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that finds the K closest neighbors of a given data point based on a distance measure, such as Euclidean or Manhattan distance. The method then gives the new data point to the class that is most common among its K closest neighbors.
