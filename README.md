# Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic machine learning method that is utilized for classification projects. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which defines the probability that an event will occur given prior knowledge of related events. The term "naive" in Naive Bayes refers to the method's underlying assumption that the features in the dataset are not interdependent. The algorithm calculates class likelihood based on feature occurrence. It then predicts the most likely class. Naive Bayes is popular for its simplicity, speed, and high-dimensional dataset handling.

Application Examples:
* Real-time prediction
* Multi-class prediction
* Text classification/Spam filtering
* Recommendation system
