# K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm utilized for the purpose of grouping similar data points into clusters. Cluster analysis is a commonly employed method for grouping data points and has broad applications in fields such as data mining, image analysis, and pattern identification. The technique selects k clusters and randomly initializes k dataset centroids. The method then iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest centroid and produces the cluster mean. After updating the centroid to the new mean, the procedure repeats until convergence.

Application Examples:
* Search engine results
* Customer profiling
* Market trends
* Detecting anomalies
