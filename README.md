# Social Network Analytics (SNA)
SNA is an unsupervised learning algorithm that quantifies the connection between an individual, their social connections, and the actions they take inside their social networks. Social network analysis (SNA) is the process of modeling and evaluating social networks of individuals. Nodes stand in for individuals, and the edges between them show the relationships between those individuals in the network. The generated graph can be used to show how people are linked to one another.
