# Text Mining & Natural Language Processing
Text mining and NLP are machine learning fields that process and analyze human language data. Text mining extracts relevant information from text data, while NLP studies computer-human language interaction.

NLP teaches machines to understand, interpret, and produce human language. It involves designing algorithms to evaluate massive amounts of text data, detect patterns and relationships, and make predictions. NLP can perform sentiment analysis, named entity identification, text categorization, and machine translation.

Text mining analyzes unstructured text data including emails, social media posts, and consumer reviews. Text mining uses information retrieval, text analytics, and data mining. It can find themes and patterns in massive datasets, giving businesses and organizations important insights.

Application Examples:
* Web search
* Chat bots
* Text translation
* Text to speech
* Spam filters
