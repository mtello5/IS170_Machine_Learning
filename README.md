# Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering is the process in machine learning of choosing, extracting, and changing important aspects from raw data to make machine learning models work better. It entails learning about the data, finding the elements that are most likely to affect the outcome, and developing new features to capture this data. Feature engineering is critical to the development of machine learning models because it simplifies the data and draws attention to the most relevant characteristics. This can enhance the model's precision, throughput, and generalizability. Overall, feature engineering is an essential pre-processing stage that nessitates technical skill, creative thinking, and expert domain understanding.

Application Examples:
* Data cleaning
* Feature selection
* Feature extraction
* Feature scaling
* Feature transformation
* Feature combination
