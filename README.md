# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
SVMs are powerful classification and regression algorithms. SVMs identify the optimum hyperplane to classify data. The "support vector" hyperplane is selected by the largest margin between the nearest data points in each class. Kernel functions translate non-linearly separable data into a higher-dimensional space where it can be linearly separated, making SVMs popular.

Application Examples:
* Face Detection
* Text Categorization
* Handwriting Recognition
* Image Classification
