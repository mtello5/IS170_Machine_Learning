# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a machine learning technique utilized for dimensionality reduction, which involves transforming datasets with high dimensions into a space with lower dimensions. It is a statistical technique for extracting useful information from large datasets by zeroing in on the most relevant features and lowering the dataset's dimensionality. To analyze data using PCA, new variables (principal components) are produced as linear combinations of the original features that account for as much variation as possible. PCA is widely utilized in many fields to get insight from high-dimensional datasets, including finance, image processing, and genomics. Data visualization, feature extraction, and compression are also possible with its help.

Application Examples:
* Computer vision & Image compression
* Facial Recognition
* Medical data analysis
* Fraud detection
